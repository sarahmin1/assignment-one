        Corey Fields, 48, was upset when he found out that an affordable apartment complex promised in the Kingsbridge neighborhood of the Bronx would instead turn into a homeless shelter.</p>

      <p>"My mother wanted to move into that building. My mother's a senior. She's living all the way up in Westchester right now and she wanted to come back to the neighborhood," Fields, who lives in the neighboring town of Marble Hill, said. "And then
        she finds out they're building a shelter out of nowhere."</p>

      <p>While residents agree that the homeless crisis in New York City should be addressed, residents believe that a permanent affordable housing unit would have better served the working-class community in Kingsbridge. Residents worry that the homeless
        shelter will become a security concern.</p>

      <p>"There's a reason why there's a lot of homeless in New York," Xavier Diaz, 27, a small business specialist who lives across the street from the shelter, said. A one-bedroom apartment in the neighborhood, he said, costs $1,700 or $1,800 at a minimum.</p>

      <p>"The middle class, we don't get no help. We just pay bills. The mayor just build shelters, build shelters, build shelters," Diaz said. "This mayor has built more shelters than any in New York City history."</p>

      <p>Stagg Group, a real estate developer, originally planned to unveil the property at 5731 Broadway as a market-rate apartment complex, but partnered with a non-profit, Praxis Housing Initiatives, to open it as a homeless shelter instead. This comes
        months after Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposal to open 90 more shelters throughout the city.</p>

      <p>Diaz said he believes the plan is not financially sound, and that the property would have better served Kingsbridge residents as an affordable housing option, especially with high rents across the city.</p>

      <p>"Let's say you have a one-bedroom with a tenant, then you have a one-bedroom in a shelter," said Diaz. "Then the state pays more to have the one-bedroom in a shelter."</p>

      <p>"Kingsbridge is a working-class community, it's not a wealthy community," said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz in a phone interview on Nov. 9. "And instead of this housing being made for residents in the community, instead it was turned into a homeless
        facility in the sneakiest of ways, and that was not good."</p>

      <p>While Diaz said he does not believe that the homeless are criminals, he worries that crime rates will spike after the families have moved in.</p>

      <p>"The neighborhood don't like it," said Jasil Curiel, 21, a student at Bronx Community College. Curiel, who works in her aunt's beauty salon around the corner from the homeless facility, said that she isn't too concerned about the property, but that
        her aunt's clients have expressed anger.</p>

      <p>"People said that it's not safe," Curiel said. "But we have the police officers here, so it's good."</p>

      <p>The 50th Precinct is around the corner from the shelter. Police Officer Juan Ventura, who works in the community affairs office, said that while residents' concerns for safety are understandable, they are unfounded.</p>

      <p>"They have their own management and security in the building. It looks like it's being managed well by the company," Ventura said. "If I see anything outside, we will handle the situation."</p>

      <p>Tiffany Green, 49, who moved into the building a month ago with her four children, said that she understands why people in the community might not want a homeless shelter in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>"Some homeless shelters are a downfall for the community," said Tiffany Green, 49, who moved into building a month ago with her four children. "But if you've got the right people running the building and the building is kept up in the right potential,
        then it can be thriving for the community and the people in the shelter."</p>

      <p>Diaz, the small business specialist, plans to wait and see what happens next.</p>

      <p>"If it's out of control, then I'll move, but if it's not out of control, then I'll stay," said Diaz.</p>
